Multithreading in Python is commonly used in situations where you want to achieve concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single program. Here are some common use cases where multithreading is necessary or beneficial:

Parallel Execution: Multithreading allows you to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, taking advantage of systems with multiple CPU cores. This is useful for CPU-bound tasks, such as performing complex calculations or data processing, where you can split the workload among multiple threads to speed up the overall execution.

Asynchronous I/O: Multithreading enables concurrent execution of I/O-bound tasks, such as making HTTP requests, reading from or writing to files, or interacting with databases. By using threads, you can initiate multiple I/O operations and let them run concurrently, which can significantly improve the overall performance and responsiveness of your program.

GUI Applications: When developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications, multithreading allows you to perform time-consuming operations in the background while keeping the user interface responsive. For example, you can use a separate thread to fetch data from a remote server or process large datasets, while the main thread handles user interactions and updates the UI.

Server Applications: In server applications, multithreading can be used to handle multiple client connections concurrently. Each client connection can be assigned to a separate thread, allowing the server to serve multiple clients simultaneously. This is particularly useful for network servers, web servers, or any application that needs to handle concurrent requests.

Real-Time Processing: Multithreading is often used in applications that require real-time processing, such as audio/video processing, sensor data acquisition, or robotics. By using multiple threads, you can perform time-critical tasks in parallel and meet strict timing requirements.

Background Tasks: Multithreading allows you to perform background tasks while the main program continues its execution. This is useful for scenarios where you need to periodically perform certain tasks, such as updating cache, refreshing data, or monitoring system resources, without blocking the main program flow.

It's important to note that Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the true parallelism of multithreading for CPU-bound tasks. However, multithreading can still provide benefits for I/O-bound tasks and concurrent execution in Python.

In some cases, depending on the nature of your task and performance requirements, you may also consider using multiprocessing, asynchronous programming, or distributed computing frameworks like Celery or Dask for more efficient parallelism and scalability.
