    "Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics are two branches of statistics used to analyze data. Descriptive statistics summarize and describe data, while inferential statistics draw conclusions and make predictions about populations based on sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics is a simple technique used to describe, show, and summarize data in a meaningful way. It involves taking a potentially sizable number of data points in the sample data and reducing them to summary statistics and graphs, allowing for insights and visualization of the data. Descriptive statistics can describe both an entire population and an individual sample. It uses measures of central tendency, such as __mean, median, and mode, and measures of dispersion, such as range, standard deviation, variance, quartiles, and absolute deviation__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, involves drawing conclusions about populations by examining samples. It allows for making inferences about the entire set, including specific examples within it, based on information obtained from a subset of examples. These inferences rely on the principles of evidence and utilize sample statistics as a basis for drawing broader conclusions. The accuracy of inferential statistics depends largely on the accuracy of sample data and how it represents the larger population. Inferential statistics can be used for __hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and confidence intervals__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence in short, descriptive statistics is used to summarize and describe data, while inferential statistics is used to draw conclusions and make predictions about populations based on sample data. Both branches of statistics are essential for analyzing data and making informed decisions."
